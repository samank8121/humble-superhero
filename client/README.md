## Team Player 
Improvement tasks in my mind which we can add them to backlog some of them are technical debt:
- it would be nice to add put all messages in one place
- it would be nice to add testing(e2e with Cypress and unit test with jest)
- it would be nice to add a util for calling api
- it would be nice to add rules for eslint
## If I had more time
- I would put all messages in one place
- I would add tests
- I would add a util for calling api
- I would add rules for eslint
