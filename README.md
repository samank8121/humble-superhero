## Team Player 
Improvement tasks in my mind:
- it would be nice to have swagger for api and dto
- it would be nice to add message service to put all messages in one place
- it would be nice to add orm and change api base on that 
- it would be nice to add k6 test for load, stress, soak and spike test

## If I had more time
- I'll add swagger to api and dto
- I'll add message service to put all messages in one place
- I'll add k6 test
