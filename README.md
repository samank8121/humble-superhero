## Team Player 
Improvement tasks in my mind which we can add them to backlog some of them are technical debt:
- it would be nice to have CORS config and check helmet config
- it would be nice to add message service to put all messages in one place
- it would be nice to add middleware for logging or sentry
- it would be nice to add orm and change api base on that 
- it would be nice to add k6 test for load, stress, soak and spike test

## If I had more time
- I'll add message service to put all messages in one place
- I'll add k6 test
